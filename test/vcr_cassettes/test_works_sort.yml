        extinction risk has been found to have a consistent negative relationship
        with geographic range across wide temporal and taxonomic scales, the effect
        has been difficult to disentangle from factors such as sampling, ecological
        niche, or clade. In addition, studies of extinction risk have focused on benthic
        invertebrates with less work on planktic taxa. We employed a global set of
        1114 planktic graptolite species from the Ordovician to lower Devonian to
        analyze the predictive power of species\u2019 traits and abiotic factors on
        extinction risk, combining general linear models (GLMs), partial least-squares
        regression (PLSR), and permutation tests. Factors included measures of geographic
        range, sampling, and graptolite-specific factors such as clade, biofacies
        affiliation, shallow water tolerance, and age cohorts split at the base of
        the Katian and Rhuddanian stages.<\/jats:p>\n            <jats:p>The percent
        variance in durations explained varied substantially between taxon subsets
        from 12% to 45%. Overall commonness, the correlated effects of geographic
        range and sampling, was the strongest, most consistent factor (12\u201330%
        variance explained), with clade and age cohort adding up to 18% and other
        factors &amp;lt;10%. Surprisingly, geographic range alone contributed little
        explanatory power (&amp;lt;5%). It is likely that this is a consequence of
        a nonlinear relationship between geographic range and extinction risk, wherein
        the largest reductions in extinction risk are gained from moderate expansion
        of small geographic ranges. Thus, even large differences in range size between
        graptolite species did not lead to a proportionate difference in extinction
        risk because of the large average ranges of these species. Finally, we emphasize
        that the common practice of determining the geographic range of taxa from
        the union of all occurrences over their duration poses a substantial risk
        of overestimating the geographic scope of the realized ecological niche and,
        thus, of further conflating sampling effects on observed duration with the
        biological effects of range size on extinction risk.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.1017\/pab.2016.33","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2016,12,20]],"date-time":"2016-12-20T10:53:58Z","timestamp":1482231238000},"page":"85-113","source":"CrossRef","title":["The

        thistle is an invasive weed that is widely distributed throughout much of
        North America, including grasslands in temperate climates of the midwest USA.
        A series of laboratory and greenhouse experiments were conducted to determine
        the effect of various environmental factors on germination of musk thistle
        seeds. In temperature-fluctuation experiments, seed germination was greater
        than 65% in both alternating (30\/20 C) and constant (20 or 25 C) temperature
        regimes with an 8-h day but less (33%) in warmer regimes (35\/20 C). Germination
        of musk thistle seeds was 37% in alternating temperature regimes of 30\/20
        C in total darkness, but less than 67% in pots in the greenhouse. Differences
        of 10 and 15 C between day and night temperatures resulted in 91 and 75% maximum
        germination of musk thistle, respectively. Increasingly dryer soils reduced
        germination of musk thistle seeds from 35% (\u22120.03 MPa) to 0% (\u22121.2
        MPa), whereas saline soils (&amp;gt; 80 mM) reduced maximum germination to
        less than 10%. Musk thistle seeds collected from populations in a bare-ground
        area had 96% germination, which was greater than that of seeds collected from
        populations growing in a perennial grass pasture (71%). A residence time (i.e.,
        period that seeds remained on the parent plant) of 9 to 12 wk after capitulum
        maturity resulted in seeds germinating more quickly than those dispersed earlier.
        Overall, reduced light levels, cool and fluctuating temperatures, and amount
        of time seeds remained in residence are some of the most important factors
        that contribute to germination of musk thistle seeds. Information on germination
        dynamics of musk thistle seeds provides an understanding of the interactions
        that affect this process and underscores the importance of timely management
        strategies in temperate grasslands.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.1614\/ws-d-13-00015.1","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2013,10,8]],"date-time":"2013-10-08T20:17:07Z","timestamp":1381263427000},"page":"549-556","source":"CrossRef","title":["Ecology
