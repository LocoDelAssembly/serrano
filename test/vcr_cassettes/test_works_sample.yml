        Psychol."],"abstract":"<jats:p>Drawing insight from affective events theory,
        this study presents a new dimension of perceived organizational politics and
        job attitudes. The motivation for this study was based on the fact that perceived
        organizational politics affect job attitudes and that personal resources (political
        skill and work ethic) moderate the direct relationship between perceived organizational
        politics and job attitudes in the context of the higher-education sector.
        In this regard, the data was collected through purposive sampling from 310
        faculty members from higher-education institutions in Pakistan. To test the
        relationships among the variables, we employed structural equation modeling
        via the AMOS software version 24.0. The results indicated that perceived organizational
        politics were significantly negatively related to job satisfaction. Moreover,
        perceived organizational politics were non-significantly related to job involvement.
        Political skill and work ethic weakened the relationship between perceived
        organizational politics and job satisfaction. We anticipated that these personal
        resources could mitigate the negative effect of perceived organizational politics
        and job attitudes. This study also suggests organizations to train their employees
        to develop essential personal skills.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.3389\/fpsyg.2021.609842","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2021,3,24]],"date-time":"2021-03-24T05:37:43Z","timestamp":1616564263000},"update-policy":"http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.3389\/crossmark-policy","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":1,"title":["\u201cWho
